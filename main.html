    <h1>The World of D&D</h1>
    <p>
      In the wonderful world of D&D, you and a group of friends role-play
      fantasy characters in any variety of situations or challenges. This can be
      as simple as fighting some goblins or as hard as saving a town from a
      dragon attack. In the game of D&D it is up to the players to choose their
      actions and to solve the problems. There can be many fun stories in many
      peopleâ€™s D&D games, and this website will show the different types of
      random events that can happen in D&D! But to start your adventure, first
      make a character!

      Now as you new character, you and your party are a group of adventures.
      Your party has been staying a the little town of Redleaf for almost two
      weeks. This period of rest was needed, but you and your party start to
      feel the desire for adventure. So your group goes to the local job board
      and takes a random fyler. This has the details of a job that needs to be
      done and the directions of where you need to go. Your party follows this
      directions and you find yourself in.

      In the wonderful world of D&D, you and a group of friends role-play
      fantasy characters in any variety of situations or challenges. This can be
      as simple as fighting some goblins or as hard as saving a town from a
      dragon attack. In the game of D&D it is up to the players to choose their
      actions and to solve the problems. There can be many fun stories in many
      peopleâ€™s D&D games, and this website will show the different types of
      random events that can happen in D&D! But to start your adventure, first
      make a character!

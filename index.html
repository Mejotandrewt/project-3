      <p >
        In the wonderful world of D&D, you and a group of friends role-play
        fantasy characters in any variety of situations or challenges. This can

        dragon attack. In the game of D&D it is up to the players to choose
        their actions and to solve the problems. There can be many fun stories
        in many peopleâ€™s D&D games, and this website will show the different
        types of random events that can happen in D&D! But to start your
        adventure, first make a character!
